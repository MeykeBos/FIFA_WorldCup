# FIFA_WorldCup

With the upcomming world cup, a friend Brenda Loznik (https://github.com/BrendaLoznik) has created a dataset around the games played by national teams. 
I will try to create a model to predict the winner of the Cup. But for now, I am mostly getting myself familiar with the dataset and trying to create meaningfull features.
